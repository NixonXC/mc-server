after that you have to paste this in "configure the run button":

IF YOU DON'T HAVE HACKER PLAN:
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar 

IF YOU HAVE HACKER PLAN (while boosting the repl):
java -Xmx2048M -Xms2048M -jar server.jar 

I have boosted the repl with Always on enabled so I am going to use

java -Xmx2048M -Xms2048M -jar server.jar
